# Desc: Using fractals and Pillow (a Python drawing library) to create art. This program generates
# three images: the first two are sections of the Mandelbrot set, and the third is from the Julia set.
# The most difficult part of this project was managing proper colors while controlling escape values to get
# the desired thematic result.

# Sam Curtis - I like that each picture has a different color scheme
# and idea behind it, and I appreciate all the creative names you gave 
# to them, but I want to understand the code a bit better and 
# thereâ€™s no comments. Make sure you explain what and how you 
# are making your pictures and also make sure you get the sources 
# and honor code at the top!
""" Added comments and sources. """

# I like the images you've created, especially the Stairway to Heaven. 
# The first thing that jumped out at me was that you referenced ymax in 
# Fuschia Infinity before you defined it, but I figure you knew this already 
# as you had it commented. I think for that one, it would be really cool if you
# zoomed all the way in and filled the image with the pattern.
""" Thanks! Stairway to Heaven was my favorite theme, and I worked hard to 
make the 'staircase' and to make the colors heavenly. I tried expanding Fuchsia Infinity 
and playing with the patters on a larger scale, but something about the 
contrast of the pink against the black really stuck out to me,
so I decided to keep it how it is. """
